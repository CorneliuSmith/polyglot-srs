"""Thai vocabulary seeder.

Same rank/word/pos/en TSV as the generic tier (HermitDave th list + kaikki
Thai extract), with curated glosses overriding the kaikki noise on the
high-frequency band — the extract glosses ใช่ ("yes") via a negation sense
and buries other function words in dictionary-speak. Thai has no inflection,
so there is no lemma folding to worry about.

Readings: RTGS, LOOKED UP (26 Aug 2026) — see
`backend/services/nlp/thai_reading.py`.

It took two attempts, and the first one is why the second works. A computed
romanizer over pythainlp's engines failed adversarial verification: 38 defects
over 60 corpus sentences in seven classes, missing สุขภาพ, อิสระ, ฝรั่งเศส and
the question particle ไหม. Reading WHICH words failed is what solved it — they
were lexical failures, not rule failures, and a dictionary fixes exactly that
class. Wiktionary's Royal Institute readings cover 99% of this vocabulary.

The original note asked for "romanization with tones". RTGS still has none;
that part is not solved, though the tone-marked Paiboon form now sits in the
third column of data/th_readings.tsv waiting for someone to make a learner-
readable notation out of it.
